          <div class="storyBody">
            <p>
              There is an <span class="highlight">unchanging truth in nature</span>: anyone who is born must face death
              one day.
              This is the reality of life, but there are <span class="highlight">two forms of dying</span>. One is
              natural death,
              where the soul departs from the earth, and the other is when the soul remains alive, but you <span
                class="emphasis">feel dead inside</span>—your emotions and feelings have faded away.
              The first is easier to accept, as death brings freedom, but the second <span class="highlight">slowly
                destroys you, day by day</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="highlight">"Once, there was a boy</span> who loved his own company. He found joy in the
              simple moments of solitude,
              content without needing a crowd. In many ways, he was an introvert—<span class="emphasis">happy in his
                little world</span>. But as he grew older,
              he realized something was missing. He needed connections, friends to share the journey of life. So, he
              stepped out of his comfort zone and
              built a small circle of friends. <span class="highlight">Life was good for four years</span>; their bond
              seemed unshakable.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this time, he also found love. A <span class="highlight">beautiful relationship bloomed</span>,
              filling his days with warmth and
              his nights with promises of forever. But <span class="emphasis">fate</span>, as it often does, had other
              plans. A misunderstanding arose,
              and the love they had built crumbled. Surprisingly, the breakup didn’t shatter him. His friends were his
              <span class="highlight">anchor</span>, his safe haven.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the storm hadn’t passed. Months later, he discovered something that shook him to the core—his friends
              had taken his ex’s side.
              They <span class="highlight">believed her words</span> without seeking his truth. One by one, they turned
              their backs on him, blaming him for the fallout.
              It was a betrayal he hadn’t seen coming. The boy who once found joy in solitude now found himself
              retreating into it—not by choice, but out of pain.
            </p>
            <p>
              A year went by in this silence, his emotions bottled up, hidden behind a <span class="highlight">mask of
                indifference</span>.
              Then, unexpectedly, a <span class="highlight">new ray of hope</span> entered his life. A classmate started
              talking to him,
              offering the companionship he craved. Over time, they became <span class="highlight">inseparable</span>,
              sharing their secrets, solving each other’s problems.
              For the first time in years, he <span class="highlight">felt alive again</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              But life, cruel as it is, wasn’t done testing him. Two years passed, everything was going good.At first,
              they stayed in touch, texting every day.
              He made every effort to keep their <span class="highlight">friendship alive</span>, dedicated and
              unwavering. Slowly, though, her responses grew distant.
              The excuses piled up—studies, work, and a busy schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
              He tried convincing himself it wasn’t personal, but doubts crept in. Was she really busy, or had she
              simply moved on?
              The <span class="emphasis">answer</span> came in a moment of painful clarity one day. It wasn’t her
              schedule or her job keeping her away.
              She had <span class="highlight">chosen to distance herself</span>. The realization hit like a
              thunderstorm, shattering what was left of his heart.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, he was truly alone. The boy who once loved his own company could no longer find comfort in it.
              His emotions died, leaving behind only an <span class="highlight">empty shell</span> of who he used to be.
              He had become a <span class="emphasis">living soul in a dead body</span>, trapped in a world where trust
              and connection seemed impossible."
            </p>
            <div class="storyBody">
              <p>
                The "dead but alive" situation, as you described, doesn’t happen automatically; it is often triggered by
                external influences, experiences, or situations.
                In your story, the protagonist’s emotional collapse begins with the <span class="highlight">betrayal by
                  friends</span> and the pain of a broken relationship. These external factors push him into a state
                where he feels emotionally dead while still physically alive. While these influences might ignite the
                feeling, the process of entering that zone is very much a personal, internal response to the <span
                  class="highlight">pain</span>, loss, and emotional turmoil.
              </p>
              <p>
                After entering that state, the emotional numbness takes over. The gradual loss of happiness,
                disconnection from others, and isolation are common responses when someone feels betrayed or emotionally
                crushed. The mind and heart begin to shut down, and the person enters survival mode, distancing
                themselves from everyone around them, retreating into a shell of indifference. Here's a breakdown of
                what often happens after entering that state:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Emotional Withdrawal</strong>: You lose the ability to connect with others or feel joy.
                  Smiles fade, and happiness becomes a distant memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Desire for Solitude</strong>: You crave peace and solitude, finding comfort in loneliness
                  rather than in the company of others.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of Emotions</strong>: You feel numb or detached from the world. Emotions no longer have
                  the same intensity or meaning—they become irrelevant.</li>
                <li><strong>Feeling of Emptiness</strong>: It’s like being trapped in an infinite, dark space, where
                  nothing matters anymore, and you're lost without purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Changes</strong>: There’s a loss of care for the past, an indifferent attitude
                  toward people, and a shift in how you interact with the world. It becomes easy to detach emotionally
                  from others, while feelings of aggression, frustration, and self-doubt may take over.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                This state is often marked by confusion, unpredictability, and a constant battle with inner demons. The
                tears at night, the random acts of self-talk, and the sense of not caring are manifestations of the
                emotional wreckage left behind by deep hurt. It’s a defense mechanism that tries to protect you from
                further pain, but it leaves you in a dark, isolated place, So, while external forces (like betrayal or
                emotional distress) are key to entering this state, it's the internal emotional collapse and subsequent
                survival mode that keeps a person stuck in that "dead but alive" zone.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other people never truly know what's going on inside a person. They only see the <span
                  class="highlight">facade—the outer shell</span>.
                The smiling face, the casual jokes, the happy pictures on social media—all of it creates an <span
                  class="highlight">illusion of well-being</span>.
                People assume you're fine because you seem fine on the surface. They don’t realize that behind those
                positive posts and cheerful words
                lies a heart that’s <span class="highlight">breaking</span>, a mind that's <span
                  class="highlight">screaming in silence</span>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tragedy is that nobody asks, <span class="highlight">“Are you really okay?”</span> Nobody digs
                deeper to understand the hidden pain.
                But the moment you slip up, make a mistake, or fail to meet their expectations, they’re quick to <span
                  class="highlight">criticize</span>, to
                <span class="highlight">blame</span>, to <span class="highlight">point fingers</span>. It’s as if your
                struggles are invisible, but your faults are magnified.
                The world only seems to notice when you falter, not when you’re <span class="highlight">barely holding
                  yourself together</span>.
              </p>
              <p>
                And so, the cycle continues. You <span class="highlight">hide your pain</span>, burying it deeper and
                deeper, because you know sharing it will only bring
                <span class="highlight">judgment</span> or, worse, <span class="highlight">indifference</span>. The
                weight of loneliness grows heavier, but you keep up the
                <span class="highlight">pretense</span>, smiling through the cracks. You start to wonder if anyone truly
                cares or if everyone is just too busy with their own lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                This state of being <span class="highlight">“dead but alive”</span> isn’t something you choose; it’s
                something that happens when the weight of
                <span class="highlight">external pressure, betrayal, or emotional exhaustion</span> becomes too much to
                bear. You withdraw, not because you want to,
                but because it feels like the only way to <span class="highlight">protect yourself</span>. You convince
                yourself that nobody will understand anyway,
                so why bother explaining?
              </p>
              <p>
                But here’s the hardest truth: staying in this zone will only <span class="highlight">deepen the
                  void</span>. The longer you remain in this state, the harder it
                becomes to climb out. People may not see your pain, but that doesn’t mean your suffering isn’t valid.
                You don’t have to wait for others to notice or save you.
                Sometimes, the first step is acknowledging your own worth and seeking help—not from those who <span
                  class="highlight">judge</span> or <span class="highlight">betray</span>,
                but from those who <span class="highlight">genuinely care</span> or professionals who can guide you
                through the darkness.
              </p>
              <p>
                Being in the <span class="highlight">“dead but alive”</span> state is a lonely, suffocating experience,
                but it’s not permanent. It may feel like the world has
                <span class="highlight">turned its back on you</span>, but you are <span class="highlight">stronger than
                  the pain</span>, <span class="highlight">stronger than the betrayal</span>.
                Healing starts from within. Take it one day at a time, and remember: even the <span
                  class="highlight">darkest night</span> eventually gives way to <span class="highlight">light</span>.
              </p>
              <div class="conclusion">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  The <span class="highlight">"dead but alive" state</span> is one of the most isolating and misunderstood experiences a person can endure. 
                  It’s a <span class="highlight">silent battle</span> that others rarely notice, as the world only sees the <span class="highlight">masks we wear</span>, 
                  not the <span class="highlight">pain we carry inside</span>. The triggers for this state often stem from <span class="highlight">betrayal</span>, 
                  <span class="highlight">loss</span>, or <span class="highlight">emotional exhaustion</span>, but its effects can be devastating—<span class="highlight">numbness</span>, 
                  <span class="highlight">loneliness</span>, and a growing disconnect from life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, while this state may feel endless, it’s <span class="highlight">not unchangeable</span>. Healing begins with recognizing your pain and 
                  taking steps, no matter how small, to <span class="highlight">reclaim your emotions</span> and your sense of self. Even when the world seems 
                  <span class="highlight">indifferent</span>, your <span class="highlight">inner strength</span> can guide you back to light and life. 
                  It’s okay to <span class="highlight">seek help</span>, lean on those who <span class="highlight">truly care</span>, and remind yourself 
                  that this phase, like all others, will eventually pass.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="highlight">You are not alone</span>, and your story doesn’t end here. The <span class="highlight">soul that feels lost</span> 
                  in the darkness can <span class="highlight">find its way back to the light</span>, one step at a time.
                </p>
